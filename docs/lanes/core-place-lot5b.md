| core-place-lot5b: place-lot owner closure | Codex; core-place-lot5b | in progress | Audit updated spec, implement all owner rows, test and gate |

## Handoff
- Goal: close every place-lot owner row against updated city-tools-input spec; core only, no ABI/plugin changes.
- Done: updated queue flush, ring completion, toll picker/depth-two network search, clearing gates and explicit zoning flags, preview occupants/drawing/constraints; closure tests added.
- Done: implementation milestone 64036f1c; first focused run 12/12, expanded focused run 23/23. Review added two more CT17 tests, rejected-prop/creation failures and preview-occupant zoning groups. Owned-file fmt passes (7 files), diff check clean.
- Next: run qbuild all once on final stable source; collect its terminal result and bounded logs, then finalize report/queue.
- Questions: CT25 visibility write missing in 3.7; CT26 detailed move validation conflicts with quirk 4.5. Literal detailed reading retained with comments.
- Failed wrapper evidence: build-runs/q/20261023-214618-30012.log (Git Bash mapping error); direct cargo works and is compiling amid shared CPU load.
- Evidence: no game requests outstanding; manifest is main build-runs/run4-core-place-lot5b-r1-manifest.json.
