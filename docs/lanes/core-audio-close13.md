| core-audio-close13 (settled audio owner contracts) | `core-audio-close13` / engine lane | in progress | Apply AU45-AU49 and AA14; test and gate |

## Handoff
- Goal: close settled audio owner contracts without ABI/plugin changes.
- Done: merged core-audio-close11 (f420ec901) and re-audio-au50 (2e9f23170).
- Done: implemented AU45 dispatch tests, director lifetime, AEMS service stages, AA14 layer lifecycle/loading, and AU46/AU49 specified SoundManager stages (pending gate).
- Next: collect focused test session 94994 to terminal, fix diagnostics, format owned files, complete tests then run all and verify once on stable source.
- AU50 filed for still-unspecified SoundManager voice/link/position/pause/Resume algorithms and sentinel bits; those paths explicitly report Unsupported.
- Facts: detached HEAD is intentional; commits publish through supervisor.
- No game requests outstanding; core-only task.
