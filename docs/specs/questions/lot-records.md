- **LR6 - section 7.1 GetLotWallEdgeFlags step 4:** when lot manager slot 11 `GetVerticesAtEdgeOfLot(R, 1 << i, V)`
  returns false (its return is not tested), which vertex range does the loop walk: what V holds before the call
  (initialised by the caller, or left from the previous edge), or what slot 11 writes on its false path?
  [the host always fills V and the loop walks whatever it filled]

<!-- from: core-lotrecords-final4 (2026-10-22) -->
- **LR7 - section 7.2 step 3:** when occupant manager slot 33 returns true with `w` null, the update path calls
  `QueryInterface` through null. Is that reachable (does slot 33 ever return true without an occupant)? [treated as a
  host contract violation: the core panics, no null guard is synthesised]

<!-- from: replace-lotocc28 (2026-10-26) -->
- **LR-lotocc28-1 — standalone wall activation:** the requested `lotocc` key would register the construction
  and retaining-wall factories while retaining native developers. Section 15.1 explicitly says native wall
  creation/update bypasses those factories and that this standalone complete-owner boundary is unsupported.
  Is serialized-object replacement alone an intended supported scope, or which additional owner replacement
  or proved installation/restoration contract is required to cover new walls? No interception is implemented.
