# watercraft: open questions
<!-- Questions about [watercraft.md](../watercraft.md). Append new entries at the END; when one is answered, move it to answered/watercraft.md. Rules: README.md. -->

- **WC1 - §1, §5.1:** who sets the byte `+0x2CC` (count the idle budget in every animation tick); no watercraft
  function writes it except `Init`, which clears it. [as read]

<!-- from: re-boatsped (2026-10-21) -->
- **WC2 - §5.1:** what the caller of the boat's animation tick does when it returns false (a boat still for more
  than 5 s outside states 7, 16, 75–78), and the meaning of drive-parameter entries 4, 11–14, 18, 22–24, 26, 30, 31
  and 34. [as read]

- **WC3 - complete public owner inventory:** the implementation brief attributes 79 functions / 38556 bytes to cSC4Watercraft, but sections 1-7 and 9 name only part of them. Please publish the exact 79-method inventory, signatures, constructor/destructor and inherited-call contracts, including return values and failure paths. Which four Init flags are set (only three are named), how are failed effect creation/base Init handled, does clearing timers also clear the lifetime limit, and what version checks does Read perform? [no complete-owner coverage claim; owner initialization portion sets the three named flags and clears all named timers including limit; failed resource creation is an explicit gap; record reader supports documented version 2 only]

<!-- from: core-watercraft4 (2026-10-22) -->
- **WC4 - sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 6.1 movement:** please expand Engine_AIBoatMotion, Movement_PositionNew and its four helpers, inherited animation/player-drive steps, and effect/model updates into executable arithmetic, ordering and failure contracts. Missing details include interpolation, steering, speed selection, water height/tilt, collision footprint construction, route-coordinate encodings, whether final docking completion is tested before or after motion, whether wake heading change means vector-delta magnitude or angle, and whether final-approach/following dt is clamped. [no original owner computation accepted as provider input; final docking completion tested also after motion, final approach dt unclamped, wake change uses vector-delta magnitude; far-approach and full animation/drive ticks remain unsupported]

- **WC5 - section 5.7 and automata section 6.6 crash/bump:** what are the exact footprint-overlap, inanimate hit, bump response, size-class and crash-sequence equations (sink/heel axes, ramps, RNG draws and boundary rules)? Section 6.6 gives accumulator writes but no crash animation formula. Does crash entry notify (0xB,0) as watercraft section 4 states, or (0xB,duration) as automata section 6.6 states? How are equal-size losers and non-player boats sinking after a player win handled? [literal watercraft entry notification (0xB,0), question-marked; threshold classification/state-case dispatch only, no full collision/crash-motion claim]
