## From the disaster layer glue (filed by the coordinator from the `glue13` lane's report, 2026-10-16; merged `e7386b0`)

glue13 wired `fc4_disasters_host` to the game (`FC4DisasterHost`) and added `disasters_shadow = 1` (`FC4DisasterShadow`):
the original layer runs and a mirror core follows it (ABI 67, taken as 61 on the lane). The lane's final run
dis-final-11 was clean: fire 211/263 lines exact, riot 2/354, quiet 0/1, and every other difference is tagged with one
of the questions below in the log. The lane's Q36 (the riot's AttemptDisasterStart) is answered by disasters.md §6.2
(it always returns null; the shadow takes the instance from the first riot RegisterDisasterLocation). The lane's own
numbers (its Q26-Q42) are given in parentheses; the current choice is in brackets.

- **DS28:** (Q29) toxic spill, terrain, pipe burst and volcano are not mirrored: no start path was exercised. [fire and
  riot only]

- **DS41:** §5.4 step 4 says an occupant rectangle with no overlap with the city "gives an empty rectangle", then
  averages it with `GetAverageValueInCellRect(x, z, w, h)` (`sum / (w × h)`). With w × h = 0 the division (and
  simgrid §4.1 step 1's one-tract test with `x + w − 1 < x`) is not specified: what coverage byte does the original's
  step 4 (and §5.6's spread) read for such an occupant, and does it refuse? [the plugin reads 0 coverage, so it does
  not refuse at step 4; unreachable for an occupant inside the city]

- **DS47 - sections 7-10, extending the exact same-process shadow:** what supported observation contract supplies the original pipe leak's sampled burst time/effect-created result, toxic occupant amount/hosed state, and quake/volcano deformation completion to a read-only mirror? Section 7 explicitly permits a different fault line, section 8 leaves effect creation without a view unresolved, section 9 describes amounts without a typed getter contract, and section 10 delegates lava to terrain. Please specify typed interfaces/slots and return/ownership contracts (or explicitly define which independent bookkeeping outputs constitute exactness for these short-form disasters). [The opt-in house schedule exercises fire and riot only; no guessed signatures, forced completion, native state copied into the core, or verification claim for these other types. DS28 remains open.]
