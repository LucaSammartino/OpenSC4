# Low-level sound, HIT tracks and adaptive music

Windows SimCity 4 Deluxe 1.1.641. RE lane `re-sound-hit5`, 2026-10-23.

## 1. Scope and reading guide

This is the contract below the SC4 audio event handler: HIT track/channel playback,
adaptive score players, framework sound services, directors and playlist input.
The SC4 request/stop chain, sound-event payloads, class registration list, sound
resources and game save boundary remain specified in [audio.md](audio.md), especially
§§1, 4–8, 10 and 12. Occupant and layer policy belongs to
[audio-ambience.md](audio-ambience.md). Do not implement those policies a second time here.

*[compat]* Requirements below describe the original's observable interface behavior.
*[choice]* An implementation may use different containers, locks, threads and audio
backends while preserving that behavior. Addresses and object offsets identify the
Windows interface, not a required core memory layout. Slot numbers are zero-based;
byte offsets in a vtable are four times the slot number.

Evidence is the Windows export's named functions and instruction records, with
addresses cited in each section. Names inherited through identical-code folding
are not reliable descriptions of a method's purpose. In particular, an apparent
window-method name in a sound vtable does not establish a drawing contract.
Unsettled behavior is explicitly tracked in
[questions/sound-system.md](questions/sound-system.md); no answer is implied by
the presence of a method in an inventory. Conformance vectors in §10 are prose
fixtures for a future core runner; this document does not add engine files.

## 2. Shared interface and IO boundary

*[compat]* These owners are nonvisual services/resources. Their inspected interfaces
have no drawing surface, clipping rectangle, paint message or render-to-window
operation. A sound **renderer** is an audio backend. Spatial position/orientation
are listener/source audio inputs, not a visual drawing API.

Use GZCOM references at the boundary: successful QueryInterface acquires a reference;
Release reaching zero destroys the object. A secondary interface pointer is not
necessarily the allocation base. In particular, the manager sound interface is at
`+0x1C`, the track's sound interface at `+0x0C`, and the track's register interface
at `+0x04`. Do not call a primary table using a secondary pointer.

Persistent input is separate from live playback. Playlist input consumes text;
HIT initialization consumes INI entries and database/persist records; track resources
read/write property data. None of these observations establishes save support for
live channels, timers or partially played tracks. See [audio.md §12](audio.md#12-save-behaviour).

## 3. `cHitTrackPlayer`

### 3.1 Identity, defaults and inventory

The constructor is `0x0093E8F4`, destructor `0x0093E882`; QueryInterface is
`0x0093A810`. It exposes IUnknown `1` and track IID `0xBB1BE367` at the base,
register IID `0xFD584467` at `+4`, update IID `0x5B34F0AF` at `+0x14`,
IID `0xAA11A64F` at `+0x10`, sound IID `0x206077D2` at `+0x0C`,
IID `0x306077D2` at `+8`, multiple-source IID `0xDD583E2D` at `+0x18`,
and IID `0xE9D00A9A` at `+0x1C`. An unsupported IID returns false without
the success-path AddRef. The constructor obtains sound-system, HIT-manager and
sound-manager services and constructs an embedded channel. Load count, pause,
error-related state, owned-sound lists and track execution state start clear.
Do not interpret constructor initialization as a successful Load or Play.

Primary table `0x00AD3E48`:

| Slots | Operations, in slot order |
|---|---|
| 0–2 | QueryInterface, AddRef, Release |
| 3–6 | interface views (listener-shaped folded entry, another folded view), AsIGZSndMultipleSources, AsIGZSndRegisterSet |
| 7–13 | SetTrackDef, GetTrackDef, SetHitList, GetHitList, CompletionTime, Reset, Update |
| 14–17 | folded entry (unsettled), PlayPause, SetErrorCondition, GetErrorCondition |

Sound table `0x00AD3D48`, at object `+0x0C`:

| Slots | Operations, in slot order |
|---|---|
| 0–4 | QI/AddRef/Release thunks, Init-shaped folded entry, Shutdown |
| 5–11 | Play(four payloads), Play(one payload), IsPlaying, Stop, Kill, folded entry, GetUseCount |
| 12–19 | folded entry, SetID, Load, Unload, IsLoaded, Pause, Unpause, IsPaused |
| 20–28 | GetVolume, SetVolume, fade-shaped folded entry, IsFading, GetPan, SetPan, GetFrequency, SetFrequency, GetOriginalFrequency |
| 29–36 | two folded entries, GetSoundPriority, SetSoundPriority, SetName, GetName, three folded entries |

Other named operations: CheckedRegId `0x0093A7EB`, CurrentPlayPosition
`0x0093A959`, SetPosition `0x0093AA0E`, SetRegisterVal `0x0093ADBA`,
UpdateVolPan `0x0093AE8C`, UpdatePitch `0x0093B508`, UpdatePatch `0x0093B9AE`,
HandleNotifySetPropertyValue `0x0093BD06`, NoteOn `0x0093BFEF`,
StartSndDependent `0x0093C0EC`, DoCommand `0x0093C229`,
HandleTimerCallback `0x0093DF4C`, NoteOff `0x0093E0FC`, Step `0x0093E2D8`.
Register helper wrappers occupy `0x0093E4B2`, `0x0093E4E3`, `0x0093E4F6`;
the float-named getter is `0x0087B103`. Names alone do not establish operand types.

### 3.2 Loaded, playing and paused are separate states

*[compat]* Load increments a 32-bit count and invokes the current underlying
sound's Load only when the result becomes one. Unload decrements it and invokes
the underlying Unload only when the result becomes zero. Both return true,
including when there is no current sound, and do not forward the child's failure.
IsLoaded tests count nonzero. There is no underflow guard: Unload at zero makes
IsLoaded true. Evidence: instructions `0x0093AF41–0x0093AF72`.

*[compat]* IsPlaying is true if the track execution flag is set, or if any
dependent sound reports playing (`0x0093AFEE`). An exhausted instruction stream
therefore need not mean the whole track is silent. Pause records pause state,
pauses dependents, and unregisters the track update target when playing. The
pause argument determines whether to pause the current source as well.
Unpause clears pause state, unpauses dependents and a paused current source,
and re-registers a playing track with period `0x14` (20). Its return depends on
the resulting error condition (`0x0093B01E`, `0x0093B08B`).

*[compat]* The one-payload Play forwards to four-payload Play with the other
three values zero (`0x0093A8BA`). Repeated Play while IsPlaying is true returns
success without restarting when property `0xFF303B1B` is zero; otherwise it
calls Kill before starting the new request (`0x0093E146`). The four payloads
are written, with notification, under properties `0xFF141C48`, `0xFF9250B3`,
`0xFF9EC945`, `0xFF1885BE`. Argument-routing mode is property `0xFF4DCD0D`;
the complete mode table and bytecode interpretation remain SS1.

### 3.3 Properties, errors and commands

*[compat]* Sound priority, volume and pan are register/property-backed, at
IDs `0x13`, `0x15`, `0x16`; original frequency is read at `0x49`
(`0x0093E453–0x0093E4D0`). These getters are not independent cached fields.

*[compat]* CheckedRegId compares its signed 32-bit argument to `0x4A`.
Values greater than 74 report `Illegal Register Id` through the HIT manager
and substitute register 1; negative values pass this particular check.
This is not a general guarantee that every negative index is valid.
Evidence: `CMP`/signed `JLE` at `0x0093A7EF–0x0093A7F5`.

DoCommand consumes an opcode from track data and supports register loads,
notes, control and timer-driven continuation. It is not a text-command API.
The inspected initial cases include register-based NoteOn with a missing-patch
error (`Could not set patch - file or resource not found`), immediate NoteOn,
and byte/long register loads. Complete operand widths, opcode semantics,
branching and error recovery are **unsettled** (SS1); an engine must not assume
ordinary MIDI semantics or treat unknown commands as successful no-ops.

## 4. `cHitMan` and `cHitChannel`

## 5. `cHitIniFile` and `cHitPropertySetTrackResource`

## 6. `cFreshPlayer` and `cFreshCellPlayer`

## 7. `cGZSndSys` and `cGZSndMgr`

## 8. Directors

## 9. `cGZPlayList`

## 10. Conformance vectors

These vectors name observable inputs and results; they are not recorded game
runs. Use fake services and child sounds to observe forwarding and ownership.

| ID | Input/setup | Required result |
|---|---|---|
| SS-V01 | Track count 0, child Load returns false; Load twice, Unload twice | true for all four calls; child Load once, Unload once; IsLoaded false at end |
| SS-V02 | New track, Unload once | true; IsLoaded true (count underflow) |
| SS-V03 | CheckedRegId: 74, 75, -1 | 74, 1, -1; only 75 reports illegal-register error |
| SS-V04 | Track execution ended; one dependent IsPlaying true | Track IsPlaying true |
| SS-V05 | Already-playing track; restart property 0; Play again | true, no Kill/restart |

## 11. Open items

See [the question ledger](questions/sound-system.md). This specification separates
confirmed forwarding/state contracts from unresolved decoder and scheduling
details; unresolved items are not implementation latitude.
